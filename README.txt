Some files ended up getting lost in my transition to online storage.
So this game is incomplete.

But, this game was created in 2011 by Travis Horne and a classmate as an educational tool for the Bolivar Missouri middle school. The game had animated characters that you had to dodge and when you made it to a new level you had to answer a question to continue. Points were gained by getting power ups and bonusses when you answered questions. A highscore board was implemented but the handler for that appears to be one of the missing files.
